    <p>
      Hello! Welcome to my page, my name is <strong><em>Da Hang</em></strong>. Call me <i>Dulcie</i> if you want.
      <br>
      I'm a CS major student at CSUF. And I have some experience in C and C++.
      I took most lower level language classes at community colleges and I just
      took CS 254 last semester. I was hoping my future job is something which
      combines sound and computer science.</p>

  <p class="facts">Two truths and a lie:
  <ol>
    <li>I ride motorcycles and I own a Honda black bike</li>
    <li>I used to watch movies every single day. And I was going to be a film major student.</li>
    <li>Canadian band Godspeed you!Black Emperor is one of my all time favourites</li>
  </ol>
  Have a guess !
